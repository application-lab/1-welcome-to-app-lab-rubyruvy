# About Me
Hi, My name is **Ruby** and I am from Seoul, South Korea. I spent my entire life in Korea, so Shanghai has been a first place that led me to explore other parts of the world. 

I used not to be a coding person as my first experience with programming in my high school was truly terrifying. However, *Communications Lab* from the previous semester helped me entierly change my view and even triggered my interest in the field. *Application Lab*, therefore, is the one that I am most looking forward to and I am very excited to continue my studies on Javascript and to work on various projects throughout the semester. Along with this course, I am also taking *Introduction to Computer Programming*, which I can explore with Python. I have expected learning two languages at the same time would be challenging; yet I knew it would definitely pay off at the end. Furthermore, another reason is that I am still uncertain of which major I should pursue. I used to consider majoring in IMA or IMB, but since I have grown my interest in computer field more and could not figure out whether I really want to study business I tried to take courses that would offer me insights in both sectors. Hope I could grasp a good understanding of them and looking forward to getting amazing insights :)
